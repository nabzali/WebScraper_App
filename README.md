# Search Results WebScraper Project

## Description

This project is a web scraping application that allows users to search for information using a web interface built with Angular. The project specification can be found [here](link).

As part of this project, I used Angular to build a reactive front-end app, which makes search requests to the ASP.NET Web API. The application has two main "views" (components) that can be navigated using the two tabs at the top:

1. **Search View**: This view allows users to perform searches and retrieve search results.
2. **History View**: In this view, users can access their search history.

## Design/Architecture Choices

[Add a brief description of the design and architecture choices you made for your project here.]

## API Endpoints

The ASP.NET Web API provides two endpoints for interacting with the application:

1. **Search Endpoint (POST)**:
   - Endpoint URL: `https://localhost:44380/api/search`
   - Description: This endpoint is used to submit search requests and retrieve search results.

2. **History Endpoint (GET)**:
   - Endpoint URL: `https://localhost:44380/api/history`
   - Description: This endpoint allows users to retrieve their search history.

[Add any additional information about your API endpoints here.]
